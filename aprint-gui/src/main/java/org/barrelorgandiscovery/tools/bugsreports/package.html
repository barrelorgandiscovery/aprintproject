Bug reporter ... Tools for the developper to report bugs, thank's to
http report sending. this package is really simple to use,

<pre>
in the application at the beginning, 
just put a BugReporter.init(name), with the name of the application, this call will init the log4j library to store all the debugging messages is a file, 
that can be sent to an http address. In this case the http address is hardcoded.

in a try catch block, at the user level, making a call to the BugReporter.sendBugReport() method will zip the logs and send them back to developers to improve the
software.
