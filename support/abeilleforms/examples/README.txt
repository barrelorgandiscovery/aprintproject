1. To view the examples in the designer, open the project file examples.jfpr.
2. The forms subdirectory contains several example forms that can be viewed
   after the project is opened.  Forms in this directory are stored in both
   binary (.jfrm) and XML (.xml) to demonstrate the size/performance differences 
   between the two formats.
