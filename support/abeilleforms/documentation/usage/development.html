   <H4><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H4>
	 <P>Once your form has been designed, you need to integrate it into your application. Forms generally require initialization by loading data from a model. Additionally, forms require event
		handlers for user input. The Abeille Forms Designer is a layout builder only.
		It does not manage Java code for event handling nor initialization. However, Abeille
		forms are very simple to use and incorporate into your new or existing code.</P> 
	 <P>The first step in integrating Abeille Forms with your code is to include
		the forms runtime JAR file (<B>formsrt.jar</B>) in your classpath. You may
		freely distribute this JAR with your application. </P> 
	 <P>It is assumed that you will be using named packages for your
		application, and we recommend that you store your form files in the same
		package as your Java source. Assuming we have a form file in the following
		package: <B>com/mycorp/app/users/usersView.jfrm</B>, it is trivial to create a
		Swing component that displays this form. The class for loading forms is
		com.jeta.forms.components.FormPanel. This class is derived from
		javax.swing.JPanel so it can easily be used in all Swing containers (e.g.
		JSplitPane, JDialog, JTabbedPane)<BR>.</P>

 import com.jeta.forms.components.panel.FormPanel;
 ...
 // FormPanel is derived from JPanel (see the API docs for more information)
 FormPanel form = new FormPanel( "com/mycorp/app/users/usersView.jfrm" );        
</PRE></TD> 
		</TR> 
	 </TABLE> 
	 <P>During runtime, the FormPanel will attempt to load the usersView.jfrm
		from the classpath. Since your forms are stored along with your source files,
		it is unlikely that they will be in the classpath. There are two ways to solve
		this problem. The easiest is to set the directory where your classes are stored
		in the project settings dialog. If this paramter is set, the Forms Designer
		will automatically copy the form to the classpath when it is saved. If you are
		using an IDE, this is probabaly the easiest approach.</P>
	 <P>Another solution is to add a command to your build scripts to copy your
		form files to your classpath after you perform a compile. Many developers
		employ Ant, and the Ant command for doing this is as follows:<BR></P>

	 <P><B>Working with Swing Components</B></P> 
	 <P>Abeille Forms is geared toward Swing Components. You can also import
		lightweight components using the Bean Manager. When designing your forms, it is
		important to assign unique names to each component (labels are an exception
		since you rarely need to access label components in your code). Components can
		be named using the Properties window in the designer.</P> 
	 <P>You can access form components in your code by calling
		<B>FormPanel.getComponentByName</B>. FormPanel also has get methods for most of
		the Swing components. The following table is a partial list of the component
		getters supported by FormPanel.<BR></P>

	 <H4>A Simple Example</H4> 
	 <P>Suppose we had the following form (<B>calculateView.jfrm</B>):</P> 
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="../images/calculateView.png"
		WIDTH="242" HEIGHT="151" BORDER="0"></P> 
	 <P>The user can enter values for X and Y. When the Add button is pressed,
		the sum of X and Y is stored in the Total field. When you design this form, you
		should name the text fields as follows:<B> x.field</B>, <B>y.field</B>,
		<B>total.field</B>, and <B>add.btn</B>. Component names are assigned in the
		Properties window in the designer.</P> 
	 <P>You could access the form components from your code as follows:<BR></P> 
	 <TABLE BORDER="1"> 
		<TR> 
		  <TD> 
			 <PRE>
       FormPanel panel = new FormPanel( "calculateView.jfrm" );

       //...</PRE></TD>

    <H4>Export Names</H4>
	 <P>Abeille Forms Designer has an Export Names feature that makes it easy to
		generate the String declarations for these types of Java files. Select the
		Export Names submenu from the Form Menu. This will invoke the following
		dialog:</P>

   <H4><A NAME="events">Event Handling</A></H4>
	 <P>The Forms Designer architecture fits very well into
		Model-View-Controller architectures. It provides a clean separation between
		your view, model, and event handlers. The FormPanel (or a JPanel that contains
		a FormPanel) plays the role of the view. It is recommended that you create a
		seperate controller class and place your event handlers (ActionListeners) in
		that class. It is also recommened that you reference all components by
		name.</P>
	 <P>The Forms Designer does not manage event handling. However, the API
		makes it very easy to add event listeners to components on your form. The Forms
		Designer uses forms extensively in the product, and we employ the following
		pattern for GUIs.<BR></P>

   <H4><A NAME="programming">Programmatically Changing Forms</A></H4>
	 <P>Some applications require a form to change dynamically. Wizards are an
		example of a GUI that must update the view during runtime. The Forms Designer
		API provides a mechanism for doing this via the FormAccessor. </P>
	 <P>A form can have nested forms. For each form there is an associated
		FormAccessor instance. The FormAccessor allows you to iterate over the
		components in a form as well as add, remove, and replace components. You should
		use the FormAccessor instead of the <I>java.awt.Container methods</I>. The
		reason is because the form container hierarchy may change in the future, and
		FormAccessor will insulate your code from these changes. </P>
	 <P>To use FormAccessors properly, you should name every nested form in your
		GUI. This includes the main, top-level form.</P>
	 <P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="../images/nested_forms.png"
		WIDTH="1011" HEIGHT="622" BORDER="0"></P>
	 <P></P>
	 <P>Assume we are using the form in the above figure. Also assume that
		the two nested forms were named "server.config.panel" and
		"authentication.panel" respectively. You could retrieve FormAccessors for each
		of these forms using the following code:<BR></P> 
	 <TABLE BORDER="1">
		<TR>
		  <TD>
			 <PRE>      
  FormPanel panel = new FormPanel( "mailConfig.jfrm" );
  FormAccessor top_accessor = panel.getFormAccessor( "main.form" );
  FormAccessor server_accessor = panel.getFormAccessor( "server.config.panel" );
  FormAccessor auth_accessor = panel.getFormAccessor( "authentication.panel" );                   
</PRE></TD>
		</TR>
	 </TABLE>
	 <P>Once you've obtained a FormAccessor for a form, you can then iterate,
		add, remove, or replace components on that form. The FormAccessor also provides
		access to the underlying FormLayout and container instances. The following
		listing shows the FormAccessor interface. Refer to the API for more complete
		documentation of this interface.<BR></P>
