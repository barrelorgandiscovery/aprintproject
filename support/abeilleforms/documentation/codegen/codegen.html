	 <H3>Code Generation</H3> 
	 <P>The Forms Designer can generate Java source code from a form. However,
		this is a forward-only operation. Java source cannot be reverse engineered back
		to a form. The feature is provided so you can completely decouple your code
		from the forms runtime library.</P>
	 <P>Since the forms runtime is open source under the BSD license, the only
		reason to use code generation is to remove any dependencies from the forms
		runtime. However, the forms runtime has capabilities that are not directly
		available in the JDK. Since generated code will not include any forms runtime
		dependencies, the resulting GUI will only contain a subset of what might be
		available in the designer. Specifically, code generation does not include the
		following:</P>
	 <UL>
		<LI>Fill effects such as gradients and textures.</LI>
		<LI>Horizontal or vertical line components.</LI>
		<LI>Some line borders.</LI>
		<LI>JList items</LI>
		<LI>JComboBox item icons.</LI>
		<LI>ImageComponents. If you want to use images, you must define them in a
		  JLabel or JButton.</LI>
	 </UL> 
	 <P>The generated code does depend on the FormLayout library. You can
		download this library from:<A
		HREF="https://forms.dev.java.net">https://forms.dev.java.net</A></P>
	 <P></P>
	 <P>To generate the Java code for a form, simply select the <B>Code
		Generation</B> item in the <B>Tools</B> menu. This will show a dialog with the
		generated code. You can press the Options button to change some of the
		formatting and generation rules.</P>
