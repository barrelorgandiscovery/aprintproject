<h3>Quick Start</h3>
<p>Abeille Forms Designer is a tool for quickly designing
cross-platform graphical user interfaces. Abeille is a Swing based
application and uses Swing components.</p>
<p>Abeille depends on the JGoodies FormLayout Manager (Abeille includes
all the software you need). Users can create forms by dragging Swing
components from a pallette to a cell on the currently active form. Once
GUI is completed, the design information is saved to a file. Abeille is
not a code generator. A forms runtime (formsrt.jar) is used to load and
display the form in your application.</p>
<p> To start Abeille, type the following in a console window:<br>
</p>
<pre>     java -jar designer.jar </pre>
<br>
<h4>Example Forms</h4>
<p>The Forms Designer has several sample forms that demonstrate the
powerful capabilities of the builder. These forms are located in the
examples directory. To correctly view these forms, follow the
instructions in the README.txt file in the examples directory.</p>
<br>
<h4>Creating a New Project</h4>
<p>Create a new project by selecting New Project from the File menu.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="new_project.png" border="0" height="412"
 width="564"></p>
<p>The Project File field allows you to specify where to store this
project information. Provide a path and filename where your project
file can be stored.</p>
<p>Abeille allows you to use images as well as include nested forms
within other forms. To do this, images and nested forms must be loaded
from the CLASSPATH during runtime. Therefore, you must provide the root
paths to your image and form resources. This is basically the path to
the topmost package where your image resources will be located in the
CLASSPATH. The same applies to your forms. It is recommended that you
store your forms in the same location as your Java source files.
Therefore, you should include the path(s) to your Java source files in
addition to your image files.</p>
<h4>Creating Your First Form</h4>
<p>For this first example, we will use unnamed packages. We will also
assume that our development directory is c:\myforms. In this directory
we will put our Java source, images, and form files. Create a new
project in c:\myforms and add c:\myforms to the Paths list in the
Project settings dialog.</p>
<p>Once your project is created, press the Create Form button on the
toolbar. This should create an empty form as follows:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="../images/new_form.png" border="0"
 height="395" width="600"></p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>For this example, we would like to create a simple data entry form:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="example1.png" border="0" height="195"
 width="380"></p>
<p>The first step is to add the labels. Select the JLabel tool from the
palette. Next, click on a cell in the current form. The exact location
of the cell is not critical at this point. Simply choose a cell that is
approximately where you think the label should appear on the form.
(note that it is very easy to polish the form once you have decided on
a design). </p>
<p>Repeat this procedure three times so that we have four labels on the
form. Make sure to include an empty row beneath each lable. This will
prevent the componets from being to close to one another on the form. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="example1a.png" border="0" height="382"
 width="600"></p>
<p>Now, click on each label on the form so that its properties can be
accessed in the property editor to the right of the form. Scroll down
and select the Text property. Enter the appropriate text for each label
on the form.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that most layout managers in Java don't require you to
manually set the sizes for components - that's that layout manager's
job. The FormLayout manager (which Abeille is based) is no different.
Components are arranged and sized based on the row, column, and cell
constraints of the form and not by manually setting the component
dimensions. This approach is much more powerful than doing it manually.
This will become evident when we want to constrain components to
automatically resize when the form is resized.</p>
<p>Next, add the JTextField components to the form. Click on the
JTextField button on the tool palette and then click on the cell where
the text field should go. You should leave a column between the text
field and its label. This will provide a small amount of space to
separate the lable and the field. At this point your form should appear
as follows:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="example1b.png" border="0" height="337"
 width="365"></p>
<p align="left">By looking at the form, it is obvious that the text
fields are not wide enough. When a form is first created, all cells are
set to automatically size themselves based on the preferred size of the
component. All cells in a row must have the same height. Likewise, all
cells in a column must have the same width. Now, an empty text field
has a small preferred width (that's because there is no text). However,
the preferred height of the field is dependent on the default font of
the field. That is why the text fields have a reasonable height but
their width is too short. </p>
<p align="left">We would like to constrain the First Name, Last Name,
Address and City text fields to fill up any available space in the
horizontal direction. To accomplish this, we must change the Column
Specification for the column that contains our text fields.</p>
<p align="left">Select the Column Spec editor on the right side of the
builder. The options in this editor are described in the FormLayout
whitepaper which is included in this documentation.</p>
<p align="left">In the Column Spec, select the Grow radio button. This
will constrain the column to increase/descrease its size such that it
takes up 100% of the available space (in the horizontal direction) on
the form. Now, select the state text field. Instead of growing, we want
this component to have a fixed width. In the Column Size pane select
the Constant radio button. Set the Constant size to 20 DLU. </p>
<p align="left">The following figure shows the control panels for
changing the row and column specifiations for the currently selected
form. See the included FormLayout whitepaper for a full description of
row and column specifications.</p>
<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td align="center">
      <table border="0">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><img src="../images/col_spec.png" border="0"
 height="400" width="171"></td>
            <td><img src="../images/row_spec.png" border="0"
 height="400" width="171"></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p align="left">Now the form is beginning to take shape. The designer
window is very close to WYSIWYG. However, to see the true rendering of
the form, you should click the Show Form button on the toolbar. Notice
that the vertical spacing between each label and text field is a little
too large. To fix this, first close the preview window. Next, click on
one of the empty rows between the labels. Click the Set As Row
Separator button on the toolbar. This should change the row height to a
reasonable setting. Repeat this procedure for every empty row between
the labels on the form. You can also remove any empty rows and columns
that surround the components by clicking the appropriate buttons on the
toolbar.<br>
</p>
<h4 align="left">Naming Components</h4>
<p>Components on your form are accessed in Java using their names. It
is important to provide unique names for each component that you wish
to access in code. To assign a name, simply click the component and
type the name in the Properties Panel. Components can then be accessed
in your code as follows:<br>
</p>
<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <pre>     FormPanel panel = new FormPanel( "myform.jfrm" );<br>     JTextField fname = (JTextField)panel.getComponentByName( "first.name" );       <br>     JTextField lname = (JTextField)panel.getComponentByName( "last.name" );<br><br>     // FormPanel also has methods for most of the basic Swing components.<br>     // This eliminates having to cast to the appropriate type.<br>     JTextField address = panel.getTextField( "address" );<br>     JTextField city = panel.getTextField( "city" );</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p align="left">Now your form is complete. You should save it to the
source directory, c:\myforms. The next step is to write a Java program
that reads the form and displays it.</p>
<br>
<h4 align="left">Integrating Abeille Forms into your Java code.</h4>
<p align="left">Working with Abeille Forms in Java is easy. Simply
instantiate a com.jeta.forms.components.panel.FormPanel object and pass
the name of the form file as an argument to the constructor. Then add
the FormPanel object to a Swing container in your application.
FormPanel is a type of JPanel so it can be easily integrated into
another Swing container such as a JDialog.</p>
<p align="left">For our example we created a form file called
myform.jfrm. For this example we are also using unnamed packages;
therefore, our FormPanel declaration would appear as follows:</p>
<pre>    FormPanel panel = new FormPanel( "myform.jfrm" );</pre>
<p>Simple example application:</p>
<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <pre>import java.awt.*;<br>import java.awt.event.*;<br>import javax.swing.*;<br><br>import com.jeta.forms.components.panel.FormPanel;<br><br>/**<br> * Example frame window that loads a form and displays it.<br> */<br>public class MyFormFrame extends JFrame<br>{<br>   /**<br>    * Constructor<br>    */<br>   public MyFormFrame( )<br>   {<br>      /**<br>       * FormPanel is a type of JPanel used to contain a form.<br>       * In this case it is loading the form file myform.jfrm which<br>       * was created with the Abeille Forms Designer.<br>       */<br>      FormPanel panel = new FormPanel( "myform.jfrm" );<br>      getContentPane().add( panel );<br><br>      // set the size and location of this frame<br>      setSize( 600, 500 );<br>      setLocation( 200, 100 );<br>      setVisible( true );<br>   }<br><br>   /**<br>    * The main entry point for the application<br>    * @param args an array of command line arguments for the application.               <br>    */<br>   public static void main( String[] args )<br>   {<br>      MyFormFrame frame = new MyFormFrame( );<br>      frame.addWindowListener( new WindowAdapter()<br>	 {<br>	    public void windowClosing( WindowEvent evt )<br>	    {<br>	       System.exit(0);<br>	    }<br>	 });<br>   }<br>}<br></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p>Keep in mind that if you are using named packages, you must include
the package name as well as the form file when creating FormPanel
instances. All forms are loaded from the classpath during runtime. If
the above example were stored in the package com.abc.myapp, the code
would appear as follows:</p>
<pre>    FormPanel panel = new FormPanel( "com/abc/myapp/myform.jfrm" );</pre>
<br>
<br>
<h4 align="left">Building your application</h4>
<p align="left">To build and run your application, simply include the
JAR file <b>formsrt.jar</b> in your classpath. This file can be found
in your Abeille Forms installation directory.</p>
