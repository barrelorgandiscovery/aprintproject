	 <P>Abeille Forms Designer is a tool for quickly designing cross-platform
		graphical user interfaces. Forms Designer is a Swing based application and uses Swing
		components.</P> 
	 <P>Forms Designer depends on the JGoodies FormLayout Manager (Forms Designer includes all
		the software you need). The FormLayout is a powerful, open source layout
		manager which you can use to programmatically create layouts in Java. Abeille
		works on top of the FormLayout and allows you to build forms visually using
		drag and drop. Abeille also includes support for images and painting effects
		such as gradients, textures, and dynamic colors (based on current look and
		feel).</P> 
	 <P>The FormLayout project is located at
		<A HREF="https://forms.dev.java.net">https://forms.dev.java.net</A>. However,
		Abeille includes all the files you need. To understand this layout manager, it
		is important to read the FormLayout whitepaper included with this documentation
		<FONT SIZE="-1">(included with permission from Karsten
		Lentzsch)</FONT>.</P> 
	 <P>The FormLayout is a grid based layout manager. Forms can be created by
		defining a grid and adding Swing components to cells on the grid. Each cell,
		row, and column can be constrained to a specified size and resize behavior. In
		Abeille users can create forms by dragging Swing components from a pallette to
		a cell on the currently active form. Once GUI is completed, the design
		information is saved to a file. Abeille is not a code generator. Rather	
  	    developers create form files using the designer and reference these files in
		their own applications to display the forms. The forms runtime is open sourced under
        the BSD license and may be freely distributed.
</P>
     <H4><A NAME="install">Installation</A></H4>
	 <P>Forms Designer requires <B>Java 1.4</B> or higher. The current download does
		not include the Java runtime, so you must install Java yourself if you
		currently don't have it. You can download Java from:
		<A HREF="http://www.java.com">http://www.java.com</A></P> 
	 <P>Abeille Forms are pacakged in a ZIP file (abeilleforms.zip). This file
		contains the following:</P>
