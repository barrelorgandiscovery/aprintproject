<h3>Look And Feel</h3>
<p> Abeille Forms Designer has support for multiple look and feels. It
supports operating system specific look and feels such as Windows and
Mac OS X. Additionally, Abeille provides the JGoodies Look And Feel. <br>
</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that Abeille does not store any look and feel
information in the forms themselves. When you load a form in your own
application, the form will assume the current look and feel of your
application. It is up to the application to set the look and feel. It
is trivial to set the look and feel during application startup. For
example, to set your look and feel to Windows (this only works on
Windows operating systems), make the following call before showing any
windows:</p>
<br>
<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <pre>   try <br>   {<br>      UIManager.setLookAndFeel( "com.sun.java.swing.plaf.windows.WindowsLookAndFeel" );  <br>   } <br>   catch (Exception e) <br>   { }<br></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<h4>Registering New Look and Feels</h4>
<p align="left">You can register new look and feels for the designer by
editing (or creating) the <font face="Courier">swing.properties</font>
file. This file is located in the <font face="Courier">lib</font>
directory of the Java release. The following <font face="Courier">swing.properties</font>
file registers two new look and feels (Abeille will automatically
include these when restarted):</p>
<br>
<table border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <pre>swing.installedlafs = liquid,kunststoff<br>swing.installedlaf.liquid.name = Liquid<br>swing.installedlaf.liquid.class = com.birosoft.liquid.LiquidLookAndFeel      <br>swing.installedlaf.kunststoff.name = Kunststoff<br>swing.installedlaf.kunststoff.class = com.incors.plaf.kunststoff.KunststoffLookAndFeel   <br></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
