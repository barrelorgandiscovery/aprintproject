JDiskRecognition.1  = We need to know the centre of the disk accurately, so please select at least five points around the centre hole
JDiskRecognition.10 = Fail to find instrument :
JDiskRecognition.11 = New book window created with the result,\n Save it or export it to MIDI
JDiskRecognition.2  = that could not match the border center, so take points multiple points on the center for estimate the real disk center
JDiskRecognition.3  = We need to define the border for accurate morphing of the picture, so please mark multiple points on the border
JDiskRecognition.4  = the beginning of the disk must be defined for the start, take a point on the line of the beginning. Don't matter if the line does not properly match in this step, the image will be corrected in the further step
JDiskRecognition.5  = Disk image has been corrected, see the result, create the holes or modify them using the toolbar tools, when finished click finish and listen the result
JDiskRecognition.7  = Pick five point to get the disk center
